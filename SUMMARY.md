**SIIM-ACR Pneumothorax Segmentation 2019** is a dataset for semantic segmentation and classification tasks. It is used in the medical industry. 

The dataset consists of 12047 images with 2669 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*pneumothorax*).

Images in the SIIM-ACR Pneumothorax Segmentation 2019 dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. There are 9378 (78% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *train* (10675 images) and *test* (1372 images). Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 2 classification image sets: ***pneumo_negative*** (9378 images) and ***pneumo_positive*** (2669 images). Also, the dataset contains ***image id*** and ***pneumo_positive***, ***pneumo_negative*** tags. The dataset was released in 2019 by the The Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine (SIIM).
